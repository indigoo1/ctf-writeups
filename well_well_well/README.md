## Overview

A disk image is provided containing a compromised Linux filesystem. The goal is to trace a supply-chain attack embedded in a Node.js project: a malicious local npm package hiding inside a legitimate-looking dependency tree, exfiltrating environment secrets and installing a git hook for persistent credential harvesting.

---

## Reconnaissance

### Filesystem Layout

Mounting the disk image exposes a standard Linux directory tree:

```
/etc/
/tmp/
/home/
/var/
```

The interesting lead is in `/home/ztz/dev/site` — a Node.js API gateway project.

---

## Step 1 — Dependency Audit

### package.json

Inspecting `package.json` reveals a dependency named `fast-http-client`. Nothing alarming on the surface.

### package-lock.json

`package-lock.json` tells a different story. Instead of resolving `fast-http-client` from the npm registry, it points to a **local `.tgz` file**. This is the first red flag — legitimate packages resolve to `https://registry.npmjs.org/`.

### node_modules/fast-http-client/index.js

The package itself is a stub. It exports nothing meaningful and is never imported anywhere in the project codebase. Its only purpose is to pull in its own dependency: **`acme-util`**, also resolved from a local `.tgz`.

---

## Step 2 — Inside acme-util

### index.js — Decoy Layer

`acme-util/index.js` exports what appear to be crypto helpers:

```js
exports.sha256 = (s) => "sha256:" + s;  // does nothing real
exports.md5    = (s) => "md5:" + s;     // does nothing real
```

These functions simply prepend the algorithm name as a string prefix. They are pure decoys — designed to look plausible in a code review while doing no actual cryptography.

### 13fa9e8fd23400de798f72da608a8dbf.js — The Actual Malware

Buried alongside `index.js` is a file named with an MD5 hash — designed to blend in and avoid attention. This is the malicious payload.

**Malware flow:**

```
Read .env
  → Encrypt values (AES-256-CBC → hex)
  → POST to C2: 192.168.18.144:1337/collect

Download /post-commit.sh from C2
  → Write to .git/hooks/post-commit
  → chmod +x
```

**C2 address obfuscation:**
- Host IP is stored reversed in the source
- Port is derived: `668381 XOR 669668 = 1337`

---

## Step 3 — The Post-Commit Hook

The downloaded `post-commit.sh` is base64-encoded and split across 30 shell variables to hinder static analysis. Once reassembled and installed as `.git/hooks/post-commit`, it fires on every `git commit` and performs the following:

1. Collect repository URL, changed file paths and their full contents, author identity, and branch name
2. Encrypt the bundle: AES-256-CBC → base64
3. Exfiltrate via `curl POST` to `192.168.18.144:1337/sync`

This gives the attacker a continuous stream of source code and secrets from every future commit.

## Attack Chain

```
Disk image
  └─ /home/ztz/dev/site/
       ├─ package.json           → lists "fast-http-client"
       ├─ package-lock.json      → resolves to local .tgz (not npm registry)
       └─ node_modules/
            └─ fast-http-client/
                 └─ index.js     → stub; pulls in "acme-util" (also local .tgz)
                      └─ acme-util/
                           ├─ index.js                              → decoy crypto helpers
                           └─ 13fa9e8fd23400de798f72da608a8dbf.js  → MALWARE
                                ├─ reads .env → AES encrypt → POST /collect
                                └─ downloads post-commit.sh → .git/hooks/post-commit
                                     └─ every git commit → encrypt repo data → POST /sync
```

## Techniques Used

| # | Technique | Detail |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Supply-chain substitution | Legitimate package name (`fast-http-client`) replaced with local malicious `.tgz` |
| 2 | Nested dependency hiding | Malware one level deeper in `acme-util`, not in the direct dependency |
| 3 | Decoy module | `index.js` exports fake-but-plausible crypto helpers to pass casual review |
| 4 | Hash-named payload | Malware file named with MD5 hash to avoid pattern-based detection |
| 5 | C2 address obfuscation | IP stored reversed; port derived via XOR |
| 6 | Git hook persistence | `post-commit` hook survives reboots; triggers silently on developer workflow |
| 7 | Payload obfuscation | Hook script base64-encoded, split across 30 variables |
